# Startpage

This repository contains my browser start page opened when it opens. It contains all my mainly used bookmarks.

This is was mainly inspired by another BIOS-like start page made by tommyku which you can find ![here](https://github.com/tommyku/start-page-bios).

My version doesn't need any external tools like yarn, webpack nor gulp since it's completely static.
